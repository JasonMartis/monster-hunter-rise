      <h1>Bazelguese</h1>
      <div class="monster-info">
        Bazelgeuse is a large Flying Wyvern covered in thick, heavy scales with
        a bronze sheen. It has a bulky upper body and a large wingspan. Its
        underside is lined with protruding scales which fall off easily. The
        monster occasionally enters a "superheated" state, causing the gaps
        between its scales to glow red hot.

      <h1>Diablos</h1>
      <div class="monster-info">
        Diablos are large, bipedal wyverns with powerful armor plating covering
        much of their body. Their most noteworthy feature is a pair of massive,
        solid bull-like horns above their red eyes. Diablos also possess a pair
        of tusk-like fangs and a large, spiny neck frill. Their tail ends with a
        heavy, studded club that can be used to ward off attackers. Diablos
        stand on a pair of stocky, wide-set legs and possess a broad upper body
        complete with thick, muscular wings.

      <h1>Magnamalo</h1>
      <div class="monster-info">
        Magnamalo is a hulking Fanged Wyvern that bears some resemblance to a
        tiger. It is primarily clad in purple and yellow plates of armor, with a
        red underbelly. The head has a short, tigrine snout, holds two foldable
        tusks under its cheeks, and sports a large pair of jagged yellow horns,
        just underneath which are its long, thin ears. Both the forelegs and
        hindlegs end in four-clawed digits, and each foreleg is armed with a
        single large serrated blade, which is kept folded back, parallel with
        the leg. Magnamalo's tail ends in a spear-like tip composed of three
        spikes that can flex outwards to form a trident shape. Hidden within its
        back are a series of bone blades/spikes that spring out from its hide
        whenever it becomes enraged.

      <h1>Mizutsune</h1>
      <div class="monster-info">
        Like most other Leviathans, Mizutsune has a long, slender body. However,
        it is one of the few Leviathans to actually have fur on its body. This
        dark purple fur covers its chest, underbelly, legs and tail. Its scales
        are light colored and resemble those of a fish. Its head has a long
        snout and is beautifully adorned by many fin-like appendages. These fins
        are pink with yellow markings, and they can also be seen on its back and
        tail. Its feet are said to be quite different from other Leviathans and
        allow Mizutsune to move swiftly on land.

      </div>
      <h1>Nargacuga</h1>
      <div class="monster-info">
        It has black scales, black fur and nightmarish red eyes, giving it the
        look and style of a predatory black panther. Its dark, feral appearance
        suggests that it may mainly be a nocturnal predator. This wyvern has
        been sighted within the Great Forest at both night and daytime, the
        Jungle, and also the Old Swamp. When it's in Rage Mode, its eyes glow
        bright red and leave a trail of reddish lines when Nargacuga moves.
        Also, its tail erects large spikes which can be flung and linked up with
        its attacks for devastating hits. Their vertebrae and tail muscles are
        extremely flexible, making the tail of Nargacuga also prehensile. Its
        tail is also its most powerful weapon. The scales at the end of the tail
        can also be shaken to produce rattling sounds similar to that of a
        rattlesnake.

      <h1>Pukei-Pukei</h1>
      <div class="monster-info">
        Pukei-Pukei slightly resembles a chameleon, with a limited
        color-shifting capability, and its eyes are similar to frogs. It has a
        pair of wings and is covered in green, feather-like scales that vary in
        color throughout its body, excluding its underbelly, which is covered in
        white osteoderm-like platings. Despite being reptilian in nature,
        Pukei-Pukei has vibrant feathers around its neck and wings.

      <h1>Rathalos</h1>
      <div class="monster-info">
        Rathalos are large, bipedal wyverns with a spiny, armored hide covering
        their body. Their outer shell features much brighter and more vibrant
        colors than that of their female counterpart, the Rathian. It is
        primarily bright red, with black markings throughout. Like the Rathian,
        Rathalos possess a flame sac which is used to produce deadly flaming
        projectiles from the mouth. The talons upon their feet are highly
        poisonous and are known to inflict toxic mortal wounds on larger prey.
        In addition, their long, thick tail features a heavy spiked club at the
        end. Rathalos' wing membranes feature ornate patterns which are likely
        used to attract potential mates.

      <h1>Tetranadon</h1>
      <div class="monster-info">
        Tetranadon is an Amphibian with an inflatable belly and a turtle-like
        shell on their back. Its belly is capable of inflating to the point of
        doubling their original body size. It also has algae-like fur on its
        head, front legs, shell, and tail. It has a toothless, platypus-like
        beak and webbed feet. Its eyes are orange and have the horizontal pupil
        common to amphibians. It also has a crest on their head that looks very
        similar to the head dish of the mythological Kappa. When its belly is
        not inflated, it walks on all fours; once enough debris is swallowed,
        however, its belly inflates to an incredible size, and it starts
        standing on its hindlegs.

      <div class="monster-info">
        Tigrex is a large, quadrupedal wyvern characterized by its massive head
        and jaws, powerful limbs and striking yellow/blue striped coloration.
        The top of its head is tipped with a pair of horn-like ears, and its
        segmented tail ends with a spiny protrusion.

      <h1>Zinogre</h1>
      <div class="monster-info">
        Zinogre is a quadrupedal monster with superficially lupine features. It
        has highly developed limbs, sharp fangs and claws. Its forelegs are
        extremely powerful and can kill prey in one brutal blow. Despite its
        hulking size, Zinogre is very agile and is able to perform many
        impressive aerial and land-based maneuvers. The spikes on its body
        mostly lie flat, but when it has built up an electric charge they stick
        out vertically into the air.
